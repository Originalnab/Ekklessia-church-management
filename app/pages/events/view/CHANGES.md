# Event Calendar Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Date Filters Set to Empty by Default**
   - Modified `event-viewer.js` to remove current month pre-selection
   - Calendar now starts with empty date filters to show all events

2. **Improved Date Filtering Logic**
   - Updated `get_events.php` to better handle empty date filters
   - When no date filters are provided, all events are shown regardless of date

3. **Enhanced Loading Indicator**
   - Improved CSS styling for the loading indicator
   - Added loading text to make it more visible
   - Made sure loading indicator is properly displayed during event fetching

4. **"No Events Found" Message Removed**
   - Removed the alert message when no events are found
   - Calendar will simply show empty without additional messages

5. **Created Diagnostic Tools**
   - Added `test_events_db.php` to check database structure and sample data
   - Added `test_events_query.php` to directly test the event query logic

## How to Test These Changes

1. **Test Empty Date Filters**
   - Open the events calendar page
   - Verify that date filters are empty by default
   - Calendar should attempt to load all events without date restrictions

2. **Test Loading Indicator**
   - Refresh the calendar page
   - You should see the loading indicator while events are being fetched

3. **Run Diagnostic Tools**
   - Navigate to these URLs to run the diagnostic scripts:
     - `/app/pages/events/view/test_events_db.php`
     - `/app/pages/events/view/test_events_query.php`
   - These will help identify any data issues in the database

4. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors or debug messages
   - The script logs detailed information to help with troubleshooting

## Next Troubleshooting Steps (if events still don't appear)

1. **Check Database Content**
   - Use the diagnostic tools to verify events exist in the database
   - Ensure events have proper start and end dates

2. **Verify User Context**
   - Check that your user has the correct assembly, zone, or household assignments
   - Events must match the user's context level (national, assembly, zone, household)

3. **Inspect Network Requests**
   - In browser dev tools, go to the Network tab
   - Look for the request to `get_events.php`
   - Check the response to see if events are being returned correctly

4. **Try Manual Date Range**
   - Enter specific start and end dates in the filters
   - Click Apply to see if events appear with manual filtering

## Additional Notes

- The date filtering logic now correctly handles events that span across date ranges
- The calendar will show events that either start or end within the selected date range
- When no date range is selected, all events accessible to the user will be displayed
