Session Management Strategy Analysis
Current Session Structure
You already have basic sessions established:
member_id
role_id
Basic authentication data
Proposed Hybrid Approach
1. Keep Existing Core Sessions
Maintain current login sessions
Don't disrupt existing functionality
Keep authentication flow intact
2. Context-Based Additional Data
When accessing calendar/event views:

Load additional context data as needed
Fetch zone/assembly/household IDs dynamically
Store temporarily for the view session
Benefits of This Approach
Minimal Disruption

Existing code continues to work
No need to refactor authentication
Preserves current functionality
Enhanced Flexibility

Load context data only when needed
Fresh data for calendar views
Better handling of role changes
Better Performance

No unnecessary session data
Load data on demand
Reduced session size
Implementation Strategy
Keep Current Login Process

Maintain existing session variables
No changes to authentication flow
Preserve current security checks
Add Context Layer

Create context loading function
Use in calendar/event views
Cache results as needed
Event View Implementation

Load context when entering event views
Clear context when leaving
Refresh as needed
This approach gives us the best of both worlds - stability in the existing system and flexibility for the new features. Would you like to proceed with implementation details?

Implementation Steps for Event View Feature
1. Create Directory Structure
/app/pages/events/
├── view/
│   ├── index.php         # Main event viewer
│   ├── partials/
│   │   ├── filters.php   # Filter components
│   │   └── calendar.php  # Calendar view
│   └── js/
       └── event-viewer.js # Frontend logic

       2. Create Context Loading Function
First, create a new file for context management:
<?php
app/functions/user_context.php

# Implementation Steps for Event View Feature

## 1. Create Directory Structure
```
/app/pages/events/
├── view/
│   ├── index.php         # Main event viewer
│   ├── partials/
│   │   ├── filters.php   # Filter components
│   │   └── calendar.php  # Calendar view
│   └── js/
       └── event-viewer.js # Frontend logic
```

## 2. Create Context Loading Function
First, create a new file for context management:
```php
app/functions/user_context.php
```

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: User Context Function
Create function to load user's current context while keeping existing sessions:
- member_id (existing)
- role_id (existing)
- Add dynamic context loading for:
  - zone_id
  - assembly_id
  - household_id

### Step 2: Create Event View Page
1. Build main view page structure
2. Include existing auth checks
3. Load user context
4. Setup calendar view
5. Add filter components

### Step 3: Create Event Query Function
1. Build base query using context data
2. Add filter conditions:
   - Date range
   - Event type
   - Event level (based on user context)

### Step 4: Frontend Development
1. Create filter interface
2. Setup FullCalendar integration
3. Add AJAX calls for data fetching
4. Implement view switching (calendar/list)

### Step 5: Testing Flow
1. Test with users having:
   - Only member_id (new users)
   - Role assigned
   - Full context (role, household, etc.)
2. Verify event visibility rules
3. Test filter functionality

## 4. File Creation Order

1. `user_context.php` - Context management
2. `index.php` - Main view page
3. `filters.php` - Filter component
4. `calendar.php` - Calendar partial
5. `event-viewer.js` - Frontend logic

## 5. Integration Points

1. Use existing session data:
```php
$_SESSION['member_id']
$_SESSION['role_id']
```

2. Add context loading where needed:
```php
require_once '../../../functions/user_context.php';
$userContext = getUserContext($_SESSION['member_id']);
```
